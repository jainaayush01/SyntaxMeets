## Contributing Guidelines 📌📌
- Issues will be assigned on a **first come, first serve basis**. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and we'll assign it to you if it's not assigned to anyone else.

- If you find any **bug** or **feature**, create an issue accordingly, and please wait for it to be **assigned to you**.
- It would be even better if you can visually show a **prototype/animation/design** for any UI improvements you are going to do so that the probability of major changes after writing the code decreases.
- Before creating a Pull Request, please make sure you have **pull the code from origin**, so that **merge conflicts can be prevented.**
- Please remove any **`console logs or errors`** if present in the code(for the sake of debugging), before creating a Pull Request.
- Please write some **comments in the modified section of the code**, so that others can understand you logic and code more easily.
- **Deadlines**: When the issue has been assigned to the user, he/she have to complete the issue within the following assigned time as per the issue level.
  - Level 0: 1 Day
  - Level 1: 3 Days
  - Level 2: 1 Week
  - Level 3: 15 Days
